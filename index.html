        <h1>Welcome to my Homepage</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Giuseppe, and this will be my website and soon my portfolio and job application. I'm really
            excited to
            study
            programming and will give it my all. I was born in Iquitos, Peru, but I live in the capital city. I'm trying
            to
            better
            understand this cyber world through programming, so I'd appreciate any advice on skills I can develop
            because I
            want to
            be a key player in this field..</p>
